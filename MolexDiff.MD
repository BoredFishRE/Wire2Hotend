# Differences between headers
Through my research for this project, I've noticed one thing that's slightly confusing. Molex has 6 different models of the same connector.
I think i've cracked the code though, and here's a guide on what the model number means.

43045 is the family, that stays the same, but the last 4 digits changes. It starts with 20, and the last 2 digits tell you what's what.

The first digit refers to the height. 0 means it's 10.29mm high, 2 means it's 10.06mm. The 2nd digit seems to refer to the mating, where 0 means the mating side is made out of tin, and 1, 2, and 3 refer to gold mating.
1, 2, and 3 have very small differences however for this use, it doesn't matter.

In my suggestion, I would use a 43045-2022 since it's always in stock, it's the shorter one, and it's got the gold plating, though if you're cheap like me, the 43045-2000 works too.
